🚩 Technical Leaders: Is 50% of Your Time Still Spent Coding?

I had an eye-opening moment reviewing a Tech Lead's resume yesterday:
• Managing 6 engineers 👥
• Handling 1:1s, backlogs, code reviews ✅
• "Coding approximately 50% of my time" 💻

This made me pause. In today's world of autonomous teams and async communication, should a leader of SIX people still have half their calendar consumed by coding?

Modern leadership principles suggest:
- Building self-organized teams requires LESS micromanagement
- Systems > processes creates breathing room
- Empowerment reduces need for constant oversight

The organizational tasks for even larger teams can often be handled in just a few focused hours weekly.

So what's the right balance? 🤔

Is a Tech Lead who codes 50% of the time:
→ A red flag signaling team inefficiencies?
→ Or a healthy sign of lean leadership?
→ Perhaps even a competitive advantage?

I'm genuinely curious: What's YOUR ideal coding-to-leadership ratio? Has it changed as your career progressed?

🛒 Why Home Depot is Sending Corporate Staff to Stock Shelves (And Why It's Brilliant!)

Home Depot just launched a radical program: Every corporate employee must work IN STORES once per quarter.

Pencil pushers becoming shelf stockers? Yes! 🧠

This instantly reminded me of what we did at La Récolte when I was CTO. We regularly sent our developers to work actual shifts in our food stores. The results were TRANSFORMATIVE.

Here's why this approach is pure genius:

1️⃣ You can't truly understand your business from a spreadsheet
2️⃣ When developers use their OWN software in real-world conditions, bugs become personally painful
3️⃣ Customer empathy skyrockets when you face them directly
4️⃣ Cross-functional relationships flourish, breaking down silos

The "a-ha" moments that happened when my engineers processed real customer orders using their own code were PRICELESS.

Was it comfortable? Not always! 😅
Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY. ✅

The tech team became more connected, solutions became more practical, and the entire business operated more cohesively.

💭 Could YOUR company benefit from something similar? Have you tried cross-functional rotations?

What's the most unusual but effective way you've built empathy between departments? Share below! 👇

🔄 Web3 Social Networks: Own Your Content, Not Just Create It

I had a startling realization scrolling through LinkedIn today:

Every post, like, and comment I make creates value for this platform—yet I own NONE of it. 

This is the fundamental shift Web3 social networks promise:

Web1: Read-only (consumption) 📖
Web2: Read-Write (interaction) ✍️
Web3: Read-Write-OWN 💰

After months testing these platforms, here's my honest assessment:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗲:
• YOU own your content and social connections
• YOU earn rewards for your contributions
• YOU have a stake in the platform's success

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀:
• Lens Protocol: Your entire social graph as portable NFTs you control
• Mirror: Writers earning direct revenue without platform middlemen
• Farcaster: Decentralized Twitter alternative with surprisingly good UX
• DSCVR:
