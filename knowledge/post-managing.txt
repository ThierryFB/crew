Recently, I reviewed an application from a Technical Leader with a very neat and compact CV and impressive experience.

🤔 One point on his résumé caught my eye:

* team lead (managing 6 people total, conducting 1-1, managing backlog, code reviews, etc)
* coding (approximately 50% of my time)

💡 This made me think. In how many companies is it normal for someone managing SIX people to spend HALF of their time coding?

🚀 Today, with lean principles, asynchronous communication, empowerment, and systems over process, building self-organized teams is easier. In my experience, handling organizational tasks can take a few hours per week, even with larger teams. This frees up time for technical leaders to code and drive innovation.

❓ So, is spending 50% of time coding a red flag for high-performance teams? Could it show over-management or inefficiencies in the team?

🗣️ I'm curious about your thoughts. How do you balance leadership duties with hands-on coding in your teams? Is a 50/50 split ideal, or should technical leads aim to maximize coding time when managing smaller teams?
