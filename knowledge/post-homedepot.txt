Attention all pencil pushers (like me 🤭)! Home Depot is shaking things up by making office staff trade their cushy chairs for a day of hard labor in the store trenches every quarter. 📢🛒

Sound crazy? Maybe... but it reminded me of a similar policy we had back in my CTO days at La Récolte. 🥗

My dev team regularly swapped their keyboards for aprons to work shifts in our stores. Why? Two big reasons:

1. To truly understand the business, you gotta live it and breathe it! 😤
2. When you use your own software for real work, you quickly see what sucks and needs fixing. 🔧

Was it always easy? Nope. 😅 But it made our tech team more badass, empathetic, and connected to the heart of our biz. ❤️

So, my question to you is: 🤔 Would you be willing to roll up your sleeves and hit the frontlines regularly? Has your company tried anything like this?
