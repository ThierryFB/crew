I built a off-grid solar system in our country house.
To take advantage of the sun when we are not there, which is most of the time, I bought an old bitcoin miner.
This is how I got into web3.
After reading a bunch of books and doing a couple moocs, the tech behind bitcoin blew my mind.
There are so many applications to the tech. Potential is immense.
