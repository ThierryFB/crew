Is this the end of traditional BI tools as we know them? ðŸ¤” 

Last week, a CFO told me something that sounded ridiculous at first: 

"I'm done with Power BI. I want to ask questions to an AI in plain language and have it learn what metrics matter to my business." 

My immediate reaction? "It'd be much easier (and cheaper) to just set a filter in your Power BI pre-built dashboard! Why complicate things with AI?"

But to humor her, I started researching options... and that's when I discovered Wren AI. 

It completely blew my mind. ðŸ¤¯ 

What makes it truly game-changing? It's open source - meaning companies concerned about data privacy can deploy it directly on their own data warehouse in minutes.

I've just set this up myself to show you how it works ðŸ‘‡

Have you tried AI-powered data tools yet? Could this replace your current BI setup?
